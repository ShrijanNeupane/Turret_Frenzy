##Game Instructions##

This is an aracady puzzle shooter where the object of the game is to clear puzzle levels composed of circular arrays of black and white targets. You control a turret from a birdâ€™s eye view in the center of the screen that alternatingly shoots a limited amount of black and white bullets. Each color bullet can break the targets of its corresponding color. With every shot the turret shoots, the array of targets pulls in closer to the turret. If the turret loses all its health, you lose, but if you can destroy all the targets before that happens, you win.

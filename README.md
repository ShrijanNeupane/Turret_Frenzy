# TURRET FRENZY
## Game Instructions ##

Turrent Frenzy is an aracady puzzle shooter where the object of the game is to clear puzzle levels composed of circular swarms of black and white enemies. You control a turret from a birdâ€™s eye view in the center of the screen that can alternatingly shoot a limited amount of black or white bullets. Each color bullet can destroy the enemies of its corresponding color. With every shot the turret shoots, the waves of enemies come closer to the turret. Collect additional bullets and health packs by killing enemies.  If the turret loses all its health, you lose, but if you can destroy all the enemies before that happens, you win. 

## Game Walkthrough ##

Players spawn in with 12 each of black and white bullets. Each enemy you destroy is worth 10 points. Upon reaching a score of 200, a boss enemy is spawned. You win upon defeating the boss. Black and white bullets have a 50% chance to drop upon killing black and white enemies, and health packs have a 1/3 chance to drop. 

There are walls that block bullets, and mirrors that players can ricochet their bullets off to catch blocked angles. In addition, at the cost of 2 bullets (one each of black and white), a "universal" bullet can be shot, which ignores walls, travels faster, and can destroy both colors of enemies.

The boss takes 5 of any combination of bullet types to be destroyed. Manage your bullets wisely in the waves, and defeat the boss to win the game.

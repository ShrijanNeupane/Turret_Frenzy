## Game Instructions ##

This is an aracady puzzle shooter where the object of the game is to clear puzzle levels composed of circular arrays of black and white targets. You control a turret from a birdâ€™s eye view in the center of the screen that alternatingly shoots a limited amount of black and white bullets. Each color bullet can break the targets of its corresponding color. With every shot the turret shoots, the array of targets pulls in closer to the turret. Collect additional bullets and health packs by killing enemies.  If the turret loses all its health, you lose, but if you can destroy all the targets before that happens, you win. 

## Game Walkthrough ##

Players spawn in with 10 white bullets, 10 black bullets, and 2 universal bullets. Each enemy you destroy is worth 10 points. Upon reaching a score of 250, a boss is spawned. You win upon defeating the boss. Black and white bullets have a 50% chance to drop upon killing black and white enemies, and universal bullets and health packs have a 25% chance to drop. The boss takes any 5 types of bullet combinations to be destroyed, manage your bullets wisely, and defeat the boss to win the game.
